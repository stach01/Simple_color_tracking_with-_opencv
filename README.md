# Simple_color_tracking_with-_opencv

I am using opencv 2 and python 2 on this code. But the idea remains the same on V3 just a slight change on the syntax.

Steps:

> Convert BGR to HSV … define the color in HSV (Lower and upper value) we can use color picker app

> Apply mask … mask is a filter, it removes all the things that you are not interested in.

> Draw contour … contour connects the points.
